              <h2><i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i></h2>

              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              
              <h4><i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> is a well characterized probiotic bacterial species and the chassis of choice for our ProQuorum system. Some of the criteria we considered essential for the strain included:</h4>

              <ol style="font-size:18px;">
                <li>the ability to survive and proliferate in the human gut</li>
                <li>the potential for efficient endolysin production and secretion</li>
                <li>the capability to express the two-component signalling system functionally</li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Regarding the first criterion, many of the <i>Lactobacillus</i> species have been shown to successfully colonise the gut and even promote its normal physiology, while also inhibiting the proliferation of specific pathogenic species<sup>1</sup>. </h4>

              <h4>Regarding the second criterion, the genus has the added advantage of belonging to the group of Gram-positive bacteria, which we thought to be relevant for the secretion of the CD27L endolysin. This is given the lack of the potential barrier of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. At the same time, the lack of an outer membrane would facilitate the diffusion of the autoinducer peptide (AIP) of <i>C. difficile</i> (indeed, itself a Gram positive species) to the AgrC receptor. </h4>

              <h4>Regarding the third criterion, <i>L. reuteri</i> has been shown to express the AgrAC system and be induced by AIP previously<sup>1</sup>. As part of our project, we aimed to show that the CD27L endolysin can be expressed and released into the extracellular milieu by <i>L. reuteri</i> and that AgrAC can be expressed and carry out its normal function.</h4>
