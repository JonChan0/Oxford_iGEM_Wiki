              <h2><i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i></h2>

              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              
              <h4><i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> is a well characterized probiotic bacterial species and the chassis of choice for our ProQuorum system. Some of the criteria we considered essential for the strain included:</h4>

              <ol style="font-size:18px;">
                <li>the ability to survive and proliferate in the human gut</li>
                <li>the potential for efficient endolysin production and secretion</li>
                <li>the capability to express the two-component signalling system functionally</li>
              </ol>

              <h4>Regarding the first criterion, many of the <i>Lactobacillus</i> species have been shown to successfully colonise the gut and even promote its normal physiology, while also inhibiting the proliferation of specific pathogenic species<sup>1</sup>. </h4>

              <h4>Regarding the second criterion, the genus has the added advantage of belonging to the group of Gram-positive bacteria, which we thought to be relevant for the secretion of the CD27L endolysin. This is given the lack of the potential barrier of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. At the same time, the lack of an outer membrane would facilitate the diffusion of the autoinducer peptide (AIP) of <i>C. difficile</i> (indeed, itself a Gram positive species) to the AgrC receptor. </h4>

              <h4>Regarding the third criterion, <i>L. reuteri</i> has been shown to express the AgrAC system and be induced by AIP previously<sup>1</sup>. As part of our project, we aimed to show that the CD27L endolysin can be expressed and released into the extracellular milieu by <i>L. reuteri</i> and that AgrAC can be expressed and carry out its normal function.</h4>

          <h3>Transformation via Electroporation</h3>

          <h4>While the transformation process was initially envisioned as a minor step that would enable us to perform more relevant assays on our system such as ki, it became a significant part of our project after many weeks with no positive results. </h4>

            <h4>Initially, we attempted to work with the <i>L. reuteri</i> strain DSM20016,; however, after unsuccessfully attempting every electroporation protocol for the species we could find in the literature, we ultimately discovered that following uptake of our <i>E. coli</i>-derived miniprep DNA, our transformed DNA was digested by <i>L. reuteri</i> nucleases. This was due to the particular methylation patterns on our <i>E. coli</i>-derived DNA. In our endeavour to resolve this issue, we turned to the Quadram Institute in Norwich, who have kindly helped us by providing a <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> 100-23c strain, for which transformation worked seamlessly.  </h4>

                  <h3>CD27L Endolysin</h3>
                  
                 <h4>For our experimentation with the CD27L endolysin, our intended course of action was to constitutively express the CD27L endolysin (due to the scarcity of options available for inducible expression vectors in <i>Lactobacillus spp.</i>). We would then assay its relative abundance inside and outside the cell. This would be determined via in gel SpyCatcher detection and/or by Western blot using anti-hexahistidine antibodies. </h4>
                  <h4>In addition, endolysin activity assays were planned to prove that cellular processing in the new host would not alter the enzyme’s regular functionality, as well as to assess whether therapeutically effective activity would be reached in the extracellular medium. </h4>
                  <h4>While attempts to express the protein in our chassis have failed, we have shown that constitutive protein expression brings about significant cellular stress; this has been determined by a combination of growth assays, fluorometry and fluorescence microscopy. Though such results have not been desirable, they open new avenues for approaching for expression strategies to limit cellular stress and strongly support the use of an AIP-inducible system.</h4>

              <h3>AgrAC Two-Component Regulatory System</h3>
    
              <h4>AgrC and AgrA are the proteins of the <i>C. difficile</i> quorum sensing signalling system responsible for AIP detection and transcriptional regulation, respectively. Their expression should be constant in the ProQuorum strain, such that we opted for their regulation by slp, a weak, yet constitutively active promoter<sup>3</sup>.</h4>
              <h4>As part of our plans, we intended to produce a reporter system containing the AgrAC couple, as well as a fluorescent reporter under the control of the Agr promoter. This reporter system would be induced by AIP., and thus validate the AgrAC regulatory system in <i>L. reuteri</i>.</h4>
              <h4>In addition, we intended to detect intermediary states in the signal transduction pathway, such as the phosphorylated form of AgrA, with the aid of phospho-aspartyl specific antibodies. However, similarly to the case of CD27L endolysin, the detection of expression failed.</h4>

                     <h4>Another workstream of our project involved the purification of AIP for the AgrAC induction assays. For this, the 2019 Nottingham iGEM team kindly provided us with sterilised <i>C. difficile</i> culture supernatant, from which we attempted to extract AIP by acetone precipitation and then detect it by mass spectrometry (MS). We attempted to enhance the MS results through the reaction of the AIP thiolactone with hydroxylamine. </h4>
