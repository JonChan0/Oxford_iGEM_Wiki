<h4> A fundamental crux of the ProQuorum system is the expression of the endolysin which is responsible for the actual lysis and consequent killing of the pathogenic <i> C.difficile </i>. Thus, there is a clear need for an endolysin that fulfills the criteria of being 
  <ol> 
    <li>optimally expressed </li>
    <li>  optimally secreted and </li>  
    <li > optimally effective </li>
  </ol> <br>
   against <i> C.difficile </i>.  </h4>

   <li>Type VI secretion system derived from <i> S. typhimurium </i> </li>

              <h4> 
                Incorporating both of these parts into pET28A, our expression vector, we planned on testing the relative efficacies of <i>B.subtilis </i>killing as per our killing assays. 
                Thus, we followed our generic pipeline of 
<ol> 
  <li> transformation of both constructs into E.coli ( (BL21 (DE3)-RIPL Competent E.coli) </li>
<li> miniprep + sequencing to verify successful transformation </li>
<li> induction of expression with IPTG </li>
</ol> 
<br>
However, upon analysis, it was evident that expression of the Dundee 2012 iGEM endolysin was unsuccessful, even in triplicate, as shown in Figure 1. In contrast, expression of the CD27L_Assay part was successful and quantitatively verified via both mass spectrometry and BCA assay, as in the <a href="https:2019.igem.org/Team:Oxford/Results" > Results </a>page.

              Thus, to solve this issue, we decided to attempt expression of only the truncated endolysin from the Dundee 2012 Biobrick, without its substantially large Type VI secretion tag. This resulted in BBa_….. (CD27L_Truncated). 

Upon analysis, there is evident expression of the truncated endolysin as seen in Figure 2. However, given identical conditions of growth and induction, there appears to be greater expression of the full-length endolysin, which may perhaps indicate greater stability.

                <h4>
                    As a further improvement, we decided to measure the killing efficacy of the CD27L_Assay endolysin as no killing data was provided for the Dundee 2012 BBa_K895005 part. As seen in Figure 3, there is a substantial decrease in OD600 over time relative to the negative controls.
