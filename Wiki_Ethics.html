<h4>
    Given the profound potential of genetic engineering to shape the world around us, ethics in this field are, quite understandably, of crucial importance. It is the constant responsibility of the scientist to consider and be aware of the implications of their research. Complex situations will of course arise, but the scientist must be prepared for such eventualities.

        When considering the ethical implications of our project, we used the excellent Ethics Handbook devised by the 2017 Technion iGEM team. Thus, we decided to breakdown our project into the main ethical issues associated with it.

                <p>Given that our treatment would involve the incorporation of genetically engineered <i>L. reuteri</i> into the microbiome we realised that some patients might not be comfortable with ingesting a live, genetically engineered bacteria.

                        Thus, we decided to talk to Zack Abbott, co-founder and CEO of ZBiotics, behind the world’s first GMO probiotic that is for sale to the general public. Zbiotics uses genetically modified <i>B. subtilis</i> to facilitate the breakdown of acetaldehyde in the gut and thus reduce the effects of a hangover. 
                        Zbiotics is marketed as a food ingredient and is thus FDA compliant. Moreover, the <i>B. subtilis</i> of Zbiotics will pass through the gut without colonising it -  a large difference compared to our bacteria.

            </div>
                    <p>Yet, whilst Zbiotics main users are healthy individuals that have no need to alter the gut microbiome, our <i>C. difficile</i> patients’ microbiome will already have been colonised by <i>C. difficile</i>. In fact, current antibiotic treatment of <i>C. difficile</i> infection dramatically alters and kills the gut flora. In contrast, our <i>L. reuteri</i> would specifically target only the pathogen. Thus, our modification of the patient’s microbiome is minimal in comparison to the widely accepted treatment of antibiotics.</p>

                  <p>For some, the very notion of using synthetic biology to engineer organisms is completely unnatural. This was quite rightly pointed out by Dr Frances Butcher, a medical doctor who now specialises in bioethics and biosecurity. As a result, we made sure to engage in discussion with both elderly individuals (notably over-65s) and young schoolchildren in the form of interviews for the former and summer schools & talks for the latter.

                       <p>Moreover, Dr Butcher led us to question the idea of including a kill switch within our system. She made it clear that the kill switch must have a scientific objective and “must not be used to solely treat societal anxieties.” In fact, including a kill switch might lead to a negative public perception as it invites people to question the safety and potential risks of our probiotic. As a result of this, we ultimately decided not to incorporate a killswitch into our ProQuorum bacteria.

                To further develop our understanding of the public’s ethical view of genetic engineering, we created a survey focusing on specific areas of ethical concern and their comfort levels with GMOs in medicine and specifically, therapeutics.

            <h4>The subsequent responses further informed our ethical outreach and education strategy. Notably, one major conclusion we were able to draw was that the public’s scientific understanding of genetic engineering plays a key role in its perception as ethical. As such, survey participants who described themselves as not very proficient and/or interested in medicine tended to be the most skeptical about genetic engineering.</h4>

This is because it is of fundamental importance that discussion doesn’t simply remain limited to science laboratories and scientific experts. The voice of the public should be heard loud and clear as they are the ones who will be most directly affected by our product.

                                    The consensus was that conditions would generally need to be life-threatening to justify the use of GM drugs. However, people did seem to confuse drugs containing or produced by GM organisms with the act of genetically engineering itself.
<br> <br> Our personal opinion on the matter, as aligned with the public opinion received, is that genetic engineering, given its incredible potential for change, should only be used for serious medical conditions. This is in opposition to the use of genetic engineering for non-critical medical processes such as cosmetic surgery. Such a moral hardline is reflected in our project to solve a critical issue that kills tens of thousands every year worldwide.
