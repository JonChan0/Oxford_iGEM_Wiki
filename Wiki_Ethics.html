<h3>
    Given the profound potential of genetic engineering to shape the world around us, ethics in this field are, quite understandably, of crucial importance. It is the constant responsibility of the scientist to consider and be aware of the implications of their research. Complex situations will of course arise, but the scientist must be prepared for such eventualities.

<h3>
    When considering the ethical implications of our project, we used the excellent Ethics Handbook devised by the 2017 Technion iGEM team. Thus, we decided to breakdown our project into the main ethical issues associated with it.
