# Oxford_iGEM_Wiki

This is the repo for the html and css files for the 2019 Oxford iGEM Team.

Each html file corresponds to a page on our wiki.

The template html file is softcoded into every html file.

The css files all correspond to one css file but the actual css to be worked on is called Main.css


Below is the workflow for the wiki.

1) Take a brief peek at your main.css (This defines most of your class/IDs for the rest of your htmls.
2) Fix the template.html to attain a functional menubar as per the 2018 iGEM page with the correct labels + links.
3) Understand + copy/paste the default pages from the 2018 IGEM wiki pages e.g from their description page or dry lab page etc.
4) Fix the Team:Oxford.html i.e the main page to give brief intro --> JUST GET IT WORKING i.e NOT PRETTY (that's priority for later).
5) Create the other pages in this order
