# Oxford_iGEM_Wiki

This is the repo for the html and css files for the 2019 Oxford iGEM Team.

Each html file corresponds to a page on our wiki.

The template html file is softcoded into every html file.

The css files all correspond to one css file but the actual css to be worked on is called Main.css


Below is the workflow for the wiki.

1) Sort out Fonts
2) Sort out Homepage
3) Sort out Following Pages: 
- Description
- Notebook
- Parts
- Part Improvement
