    <p>It is fascinating to see what other iGEM teams are achieving and it is so valuable to pool the skills of so many imaginative, motivated people. These are all the teams we have had the priviledge of working with. </p>

    <h2>VIT Vellore</h2>
<br>
    <p>We have been mentoring the VIT Vellore team, with regards to the modelling. We helped them formulate differential equations to describe their system. We also contributed to debugging of the programme through weekly meetings and technical support.</p>

    <h2>Nottingham</h2>
<br>
    <p>We were very lucky to receive samples of C.difficile supernatant from the Nottingham team. These have helped us to characterise the C.difficile AIP and we hope to use it to test our C.difficile detection system. </p>

    <h2>UCL</h2>
<br>
    <p>UCL have developed a fantastic sustainability scheme called Little Leaf in conjunction with the LEAF. You can read more about it here https://2019.igem.org/Team:UCL/Sustainability.
We have helped them to develop a protocol for maximising the recycling of resources from previous iGEM teams, which we hope to distribute across the iGEM teams to encourage and foster the spirit of sustainability. We do believe iGEM and all lab scientists take greater care in their environmental impact, despite the wonderful work that they do, we all have a responsibility to minimise our impact on the environment at the same time. </p>

    <h2>Leiden</h2>
 <br>
    <p> We have worked with Leiden's iGEM team to produce and distribute a survey to gauge public opinion and understanding of genetic engineering techonology. We are using this to inform our Human Practices Outreach work so that we can narrow the gap between understanding and use of genetic engineering.</p>
