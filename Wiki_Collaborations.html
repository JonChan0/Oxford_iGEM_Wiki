    <p>It is fascinating to see what other iGEM teams are achieving and it is so valuable to pool the skills of so many imaginative, motivated people. These are all the teams we have had the priviledge of working with. </p>

    <h2>VIT Vellore</h2>
<br>
    <p>We have been mentoring the VIT Vellore team, with regards to the modelling. We helped them formulate differential equations to describe their system. We also assisted them with the debugging of the programme through weekly meetings and technical support.</p>

    <h2>Leiden & Copenhagen</h2>
 <br><br>
    <p> An important aspect of our project was understanding how our individual projects that all involve using GM bacteria for therapeutic purposes would be perceived by the public. Public perception can often be a barrier between scientific progress and real world application. Therefore we teamed up with iGEM Copenhagen and iGEM Leiden who are also both working on medical GMOs (Copenhagen is working on a bubble gum for diagnosis of female hormone disbalance and Leiden is working on a therapeutic hydrogel for treating burns) to produce and distribute a survey to gauge public opinion and understanding of genetic engineering.
<br><br>
The main objectives of our surveys were to determine the public’s knowledge of GMOs,  identify any specific areas of concern with genetic engineering, access their comfort level with GMOs in medicine and specifically therapeutics and with our projects in particular, e.g. the different delivery methods or modes of actions of our drugs. We are using the data from the survey to inform our Human Practices Outreach work so that we can narrow the gap between understanding and use of genetic engineering.
         <br><br>
    Some of the important results of our survey are highlighted here:

    <centre><div class="panel-body"><p>Our methods for conducting the survey were approved by our supervisors as well as the institution. We designed our survey in compliance with  the AAPOR  Task Force report “Evaluating Survey Quality in Today’s Complex Environment” and Best Practices for Survey Research guidelines: The survey was anonymised and our methods for conducting the survey were approved by our PIs and the institution, respectively. We pretested questionnaires and procedures and afterwards we tallied all of the surveys to get our final results. The survey itself contained a disclaimer paragraph informing the participants about the purpose of the survey, and contact information for any concerns. This was followed by two demographics questions, and then five questions designed to better understand public understanding, reaction and opinion of GMOs. Finally, two questions were designed to give us specific opinions about the drug designs of our individual projects. In the end participants could give us any further comments on our projects or survey, as well as any concerns. We purposefully decided against a fully multiple choice survey to give participants the chance to give their differentiated and unbiased opinion. Finally, we performed a detailed analysis of the survey to get the final results.       
        <br><br>      Overall, 221 people filled out our survey. Because it was an online survey, and we sent it out through social media amongst others we were aware that our polling population might have some bias. We saw this bias in our demographic results, where the average age was 29.3 years old and 24% were within typical university student age. However, we still think that our data can provide some useful insights into the general population’s opinions. 
        102 of the participants were from the UK, 54 from the Netherlands, 31 from Denmark, and 35 from other countries. As our survey was online and we used social media to publicise it, we were aware that our polling population might have some bias. As expected, we saw this bias in our demographic results, where the average age was 29.3 years old and 24% were within typical university student age. From graph 1 it can be seen that the majority of the people that answered our survey were under 25 years old: 64,5% were under 25 years old, 16,8% were between 25-40 years old, 12,1% were between 41-65 years old and 6,5% were over 65 years old. However, we still think that our data can provide some useful insights into the general public’s opinion.

      <p>The aim of the survey was to understand the general opinion about genetically modified organisms.  Our survey showed that most people are actually quite positive about genetic engineering. People over 65 years old are the most enthusiastic about genetic engineering. Amongst them over 60% answered that they are positive about genetic engineering, and 20 were positive to have GMOs with conditions. 20% were indecisive. The people under 25-year-old were the next most accepting of genetic engineering, then the people between 25-40 years old. The people between 41-65 were the least accepting of genetic engineering although only 12% were negative about it.
 
        <br><br> However, we need to be careful with the interpretation here since this could be also due to the sampling population since the survey was sent out by iGEM participants to their friends / family and the immediate surroundings of people working in iGEM might be positively biased since they are all in some way related to a person who has knowledge about this subject and also passionate about educating people on it.

    <br>
    <p>Most of the people answering our survey have heard about genetic engineering in school (62%). A lot of the people answering our survey have also heard about genetic engineering in scientific publications and popular science media, suggesting that a lot of the people answering our survey are scientists. A lot of the people answering our survey have also heard about genetic engineering through general media showing that genetic engineering is a subject getting a lot of attention in the media currently.  As one participant mentioned: <i>“A lot of people (including myself) do not know that much about it [genetic engineering]. They have probably heard the word in school and some examples, but not really know the consequences or if it is really good or bad.”</i> Therefore, we should be careful in interpreting these results, in combination with our data on the opinions.</p>

    <br>
    <p>We asked all participants to name an example of genetic engineering, so we could estimate where their knowledge came from. We categorised their answers into: ‘agriculture/food’, ‘medicine’, ‘science’ and ‘no/wrong example’. It is interesting to note that each age group has a major area of knowledge: medicine (47.4%) for participants from 25-40; agriculture (65.4%) for participants from 41-65; science (60.0%) for participants of 65+. The group of participants under 25 years old had the most divided answers, but still ‘agriculture’ had a majority with 43.8%.</p>

    <br>
    <p>90% of participants said that they would take a GMO therapeutic, compared to 88% who would consider taking a diagnostic and 78% a preventative GMO. Based on this insight we will market our product as therapeutic in combination with a preventative (not solemnly preventative). 
      75% stated that they would be comfortable with an internal targeted pill, more than any other delivery method. Only an external gel was more accepted with 77%. Therefore, we decided to have our product delivered via a targeted pill capsule.</p>

      <br>
      <p>We further tried to find out what a GMO drug would need to fulfill to replace a traditional treatment. From graph 7 we can conclude that people find effectiveness more important than price when judging whether to use a product containing a GMO. Of all participants, 89% indicated that they could be convinced by a GMO treatment with increased effect at a comparable or lower price, whereas 60% would consider a GMO drug with a lower price, but similar effectiveness. 72% would try a GMO treatment if there is no corresponding traditional treatment for that condition yet. This would be important to implement into the development of our products. It is also interesting to mention that 43% said they would still consider a GMO medicine even without an obvious advantage in effectiveness or price. This, in combination with the overall high response, provides further indication to the positive attitude towards GMO treatment. This might be due to the education people have received on genetic engineering, as one participant highlighted that “people can be very fearful about new technology and myths are spread. Educating people will benefit society by reducing people’s reservations about GMOs so they can get the most effective treatment possible”.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>We have to be careful drawing conclusions since our survey didn’t reach enough people and because it was distributed through social media it has reached a lot of our friends that are studying science at university and are more prone to being positive towards GMOs. However, from our survey, it can be concluded that people have a rather positive opinion towards GMO and are not against using GMO products.</p>
<h4><b>Summary of Conclusions</b></h4>
  <ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-size: 16px;">
  <li>Most of our participants were under 25 (64.5%) and from the UK (47.1%).</li>
  <li>The participants had a general positive attitude towards genetic engineering (51% was positive, and 31% was positive with conditions).</li>
  <li>The majority of the participants had previously heard about genetic engineering (mostly through school: 62%). </li>
  <li>Each age group had a specific category where they knew genetic engineering from.</li>
  <li>People are more agreeable towards products from GMOs when applied external as opposed to internal.</li>
  <li>Effectiveness of a product is important when distinguishing between a medical product from a GMO and a non-GMO source.</li>
  <li>In general, The data suggest that the majority of participants had a scientific background, as evident from their source of information about genetic engineering. In addition, the general positive attitude towards genetic engineering indicates scientific background as well.</li>

    <br>
        <p>UCL have developed a fantastic sustainability scheme called Little Leaf in conjunction with the LEAF. You can read more about it <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:UCL/Sustainability">here</a>.
    We have helped them to develop a protocol for maximising the recycling of resources from previous iGEM teams, which we hope to distribute across the iGEM teams to encourage and foster the spirit of sustainability. We do believe iGEM and all lab scientists take greater care in their environmental impact, despite the wonderful work that they do, we all have a responsibility to minimise our impact on the environment at the same time. </p>

<h2>Queens</h2>
<br>
<p>In our survey people often pointed out that a video would be a good way to explain the concepts of Genetic Engineering. Therefore, we decided to team up with other iGEM teams to produce an interesting and accessible video answering frequently asked questions and explaining common words and techniques used in genetic engineering. We worked together with National Chiao Tung University, University of British Columbia, University of Calgary, University of Toronto and University of Ottawa - with the University of Queens coordinating the collaboration.</p>

<p>The Newcastle iGEM team graciously hosted our team and the UK iGEM team meetup on their campus. We were able to discuss our projects in great depth with each other and helped to improve our presentations and projects, so their initial feedback helped us in how we approach other teams. Our collaboration with Exeter iGEM also originated from this meetup! </p>
