          <h4>In order to present reproducible data, we wanted to convert our results into a format that enables a unified comparison between different measurements and instruments. To create this conversion, we used the iGEM Measurement kit, as provided in the iGEM 2019 Distribution kit. This includes fluorescein salt and silica beads which serve as standardised conversion units for Fluorescence Intensity and OD600 respectively.</h4>

          <h4>Using this kit, we obtained standard curves for fluorescein (Figure 1) and particle count (Figure 2). The R<sup>2</sup> for fluorescein is 0.9923, whereas for particle count, R<sup>2</sup>=0.9950.</h4>

          <h2>Killing Assay</h2>

          <h4>To quantify the effects of the CD27L endolysin, we needed an assay which showed whether it was functional. From preliminary research, we found that CD27L, besides being highly specific to <i>Clostiridoides difficile</i>, is also able to cleave the cell wall of several other bacteria with the same peptidoglycan type, A1γ. Namely, we used <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, a Category 1 Gram-positive bacteria<sup>1</sup> due to safety concerns.</h4>
          <h4>In order to assay whether <i>B. subtilis</i> is lysed by our endolysin, we measured absorbance at 600nm (OD600) throughout an 8 hour time period at every 15 minutes. This way, we were able to monitor how the <i>B. subtilis</i> culture is affected by CD27L. </h4>
          <h4>Our kill assay differs from the one described by Mayer et al. (2008)<sup>1</sup>. Their protocol involved washing and concentrating the cells to OD600 = 2.0 in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), following by mixing with CD27L and measuring the rate of decrease in OD600. </h4>
          <h4>In our case, we grew up a <i>B. subtilis</i> culture until they reached mid-log phase (OD600 ≈ 0.6), then diluted them in Lysogenic Broth (LB), added our solution (CD27L or Lysozyme or PBS) and then measured the growth over time by monitoring the change in OD600. The measurements were made automatically by a plate reader, BMG FLUOstar Omega and the cells were grown in a 96 well plate from Greiner (CellStar® 96 well plate F-type). </h4>  
        <h4>The use of a plate reader allowed us to measure the absorbance at OD600 over a long time period, which greatly reduces the possible human error. Additionally, the instrument allowed us to conduct experiments on a larger scale than otherwise possible. Notably, it is capable  of incubating the cells at 37 °C and shaking at 500 rpm, which helped to carry out the experiments in a reproducible manner. Furthermore, to increase confidence in our results, our experiments were always carried out in triplicates so that we could perform statistical analysis from our results.</h4>
        <h4>Having a rigorous protocol for preparing the samples and utilising an instrument allowing consistency across measurements enabled us to generate more trustworthy and reliable data.</h4>

            <h4> One concern over our starting OD600 was the accuracy of the machine. According to the manufacturer’s website, the accuracy of the instrument at OD 2.0 is less than 1%, the precision at OD 1.0 is &lt;0.5%, and &lt;0.8% at OD 2.0 and it increases with higher ODs. Hence, we diluted our samples to 0.01 so that most of the values from our measurements are within the range of 0.1-1.5. 
            </h4>

            <h4>
                However, on our plate reader, we set the plate reader to normalize the measurements to 1 cm. Thus, our presented data has a higher OD600 than absorbance measured in the plate reader due to the shorter path length in the 96-well plate. Consequently, our data still falls within the range of OD 0.1-1.5, where the machine’s precision is at its highest. 
            </h4>
            <h4>This method proved us that our endolysin is able to kill and inhibit the growth of <i>B. subtilis</i> in growth media. This assay gives a much more powerful insight into how we need to design our product, how it will behave in a more realistic scenario and where the cells are actually growing while CD27L has to kill the target.</h4>

                    <h4>Instead, we used densitometric measurements in SDS-PAGE gels following Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining using BioRad’s Chemidoc XRS and Image Lab (6.0.1) software to measure Lane Percentage (%), which we refer to as lane purity.</h4>

                    <h4>Firstly, to use this method, we created a standard curve to test whether densitometry scales linearly and whether purity values changes with different concentrations of protein loaded. For our trial protein, we used partially purified mClover3 (via IMAC). Then, we created a series of dilutions and loaded them onto the same SDS-PAGE gel. Following staining with Coomassie Blue and destaining, we captured the image and analysed with Image Lab. The bands and lanes were detected automatically via the software.</h4>

These three samples included sterile culture media, supernatant from a 3 hour pre-log phase culture and supernatant from a 48hr culture. All three samples were purified as in the first few steps of Darkoh et al. (2014)<sup>2</sup>’s purification.</h4>

                                <li> The resulting supernatant was precipitated in 60% ice-cold acetone and incubated overnight at -20&#8451;.</li>
                                <li> The resulting precipitate is centrifuged at 1,000 x <i>g</i> for 20 minutes, and the pellet then resuspended in 40 mL of Milli-Q water, sterilised via a 0.2 &mu;m surfactant-free cellulose acetate (SFCA) filter (Corning Inc., Corning, NY)</li>

It proved to be a sensitive and effective technique for determining the composition of our supernatants. We used the spectra that were gathered from ESI-MS to try and identify whether the AIP was present in the supernatant of any of our samples, particularly the 3-hour pre-log and the 48-hour stationary phase samples</h4>
