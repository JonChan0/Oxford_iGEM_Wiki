                The problem now
              </h2>

              <h4>
                  <i> C. difficile</i> infection (CDI) is the leading cause of hospital and nursing home acquired infection in the developed world. Today, nearly half of all hospitalised patients are prescribed antibiotics. These antibiotics drastically alter the gut flora, killing both beneficial and pathogenic bacteria alike. Such a shift in the dynamics of the gut microbiome allows opportunistic bacteria like <i>C. difficile</i> to  propagate. The resulting toxins produced by <i>C. difficile</i> toxins lead to extremely unpleasant symptoms such as diarrhoea, bowel perforation and severe dehydration. Presently, patients over the age of 65 account for more than 80% of the deaths from CDI. As such, our ever-aging populations coupled with the inevitable rise of antibiotic resistance makes <i>C. difficile</i> a major threat.

                    <h2>
                      So how bad is <i> C. difficile</i>?
                    </h2>

                    <h4> There are approximately 500,000 infections per year in the US alone.  Of those 500,000 infections 30,000 result in death<sup>1</sup>. Moreover, there are also severe economic repercussions of CDI. In fact, extra costs associated with treating it amount to around $4.8 billion USD per year - a severe burden on healthcare systems around the world. Additionally, CDI has a 20% to 30% rate of recurrence<sup>2</sup>>. This makes it significantly more troublesome to treat, especially with regards to the proliferation of resistant strains.
<br> <br>
                        These repeated infections can be partly attributed to <i>C. difficile</i> spore formation. These heat, acid, antibiotic and bleach resistant spores allow the <i>C. difficile</i> to persist in both the gut and the external  environment and  In fact, such spores are “plentiful in healthcare facilities” as reported by Leffler et al. (2015)<sup>3</sup>, thus contributing to the patient-to-patient spread and recurrence rate. Combined, these factors illustrate the need for  an alternative and effective treatment.

                              Our Solution
                            </h2>

                            <h4>
                                We hope to change these alarming statistics with a novel treatment against <i>C. difficile</i>infections. Our project, ProQuorum, combines the power of probiotics and quorum sensing to cure <i>C. difficile</i>infections. 
<br><br>
                                Specifically, we are engineering <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, a natural resident of the human gut, to detect and kill virulent <i>C. difficile</i>bacteria. These super-probiotic bacteria, upon detection of the <i>C. difficile</i>, release a <i>C. diff.</i>specific endolysin. This cleaves <i>C. diff</i>’s peptidoglycan cell wall and causes lysis.

                              What was the inspiration for our project?
                            </h2>

                            <h4>
                                When we first began brainstorming for our project, our team had a wide variety of ideas which coupled synthetic biology to solving current societal issues. Several environmental projects were researched, including the production of biofuels using cyanobacteria to combat climate change and the optimisation of ethanol production using <i>E.coli</i>. We also looked at many therapeutic projects, which drew our attention because of their potential to directly address disease. Phage therapy, bacteria that could treat skin-disease, celiac disease or even asthma were all researched thoroughly. All these projects provided solutions to important cases, but we wanted our project to have a maximal impact and felt that our final chosen project achieved just that.
<br><br>
                                Many of us were concerned about the ever-looming threat of antibiotic resistance. It was at the Biohackathon, hosted by the Oxford University Biotech Society, where we discovered the scope of <i>C. difficile</i> infection (CDI). The Centres for Disease Control (CDC) had cited <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> as one of the 3 most “urgent threats” with regard to antimicrobial resistance. Of the three, it has the highest incidence of infections per year<sup>1</sup>. We decided to take it upon ourselves to respond to the CDC’s call to arms and provide an alternative treatment to <i>C. difficile</i> infection. We hoped to create a system which combatted <i>C. difficile</i> to provide a more specific alternative to antibiotic treatment. Our vision became much more tangible when we  discovered that an effective endolysin against <i>C. difficile</i> called CD27L already existed.  
                                <br>Although the core of our original idea has not changed, our project has greatly evolved since its inception. Both our integrated human practices and modelling have proved crucial in deciding the direction that we have taken for ProQuorum.
                                <br><br>
                                At first, we were unsure on the choice of the bacteria that we would use as our chassis. It was Dr. David Eyre, a <i>C. difficile</i> expert, who first suggested that we explore <i>Lactobacillus</i> strains, as these bacteria are already well adapted to colonize the human microbiome. We then decided to use <i>L. reuteri</i> as our chassis due to its intrinsic resistance to metrodinazole, vanocymin and fidoamicin as noted by Spinler et al. (2017)<sup>4</sup> and its ability to secrete reuterin, a broad spectrum antibiotic when in the presence of glycerol. Together, these tools make wild-type <i>L. reuteri</i> an effective  <i>C. difficile</i>suppressant.
                                <br><br>
                                Having decided on our chassis, we wanted to maximise the efficiency of our treatment. We had originally thought that it was best for our transformed <i>Lactobacillus</i> - which we call ProQuorum - to constantly produce our CD27L endolysin. In this scenario, a patient would ingest our probiotic, and our transformed <i>L. reuteri</i>would begin growing in the gut, similar to what may happen after ingesting <i>Lactobacillus</i> cultures in yogurt.The <i>L. reuteri</i> would then produce a steady supply of the CD27L endolysin. to ultimately kill off the <i>C. difficile</i> and resolve the infection.
                                <br><br>
                                However, after modelling two different systems where the endolysin was either produced continually or only when induced, we realized that cell  stress and its effect on growth rate needed to be taken into account. We found that induction was critical to our system’s success and began the hunt for a <i9>C. difficile</i9>-sensing switch.
                                <br>We decided to sense <i>C. difficile</i> by turning its own molecular machinery against itself, by incorporating the  <i>C. diff.</i>quorum sensing mechanism into our system. Under the control of this system, our L. reuteri would only secrete our endolysin  in the presence of a quorum of <i>C. difficile</i>. Not only did this create a dynamic system which limits perturbations to the gut flora through exogenous endolysin secretion, but it also sparked the name for our project: ProQuorum, a fusion of “probiotic” and “quorum sensing”.
                                <br><br>
                                We believe we have made great strides in the eventual completion of this project. We have shown the specificity and efficacy of our CD27L and validated a method of transformation it into <i>L. reuteri</i> - a difficult non-traditional bacteria to work with. Although we have had some success in transforming part of the quorum sensing system into <i>E.coli</i>, we are not yet at the stage where our ProQuorum bacteria are able to detect <i>C. difficile</i>’s auto-inducing peptide (AIP).

                                        </h2>

                                        <h4>
                                            Synthetic biology allows for a specific and targeted approach for our <i>C. difficile</i> treatment. Current methods of treating <i>C. difficile</i> involve further antibiotic treatment (namely vancomycin) or fecal transplants. Traditional broad-spectrum antibiotics, like vancomycin, drastically alter a patient’s gut flora and have been less effective against recurrent CDI. Fecal transplants, while proving to be an effective alternative to antibiotics, often requires an invasive colonoscopy for the fecal sample to be introduced to the colon. Both options are costly, at over $3,000 USD per treatment.
<br><br>
                                            A Synthetic Biology approach would address both of these issues. Firstly, ProQuorum  preserves patients’ unique microbiome through the high specificity of its endolysin. The ProQuorum detection system ensures that the <i>C. diff</i>-specific endolysin is only secreted when <i>C. difficile</i> is present. By introducing the endolysin into <i>L. reuteri</i> bacteria, its production is confined to the gut, providing a more targeted approach than simply introducing the CD27L endolysin intravenously (IV). Moreover, high local endolysin concentrations are more likely tolerated to ensure <i>C. difficile</i> lysis without significant intervention of the human immune system, a genuine concern if endolysin is administered through IV. As a result, this makes Synthetic Biology necessary to achieve both specificity and potency in combating CDI.
