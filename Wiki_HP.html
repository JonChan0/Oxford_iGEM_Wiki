          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <br>
            <p> Human practices has been a core focus of our project during its entirety. As a therapeutic we have been interacting with patients and at risk groups, who could be future patients to identify their needs and provide for them, ensuring that we are increasing the quality of their care. Interviews with previous C. difficile infection (CDI) patients have helped us to decide on our delivery method and validate our safety considerations. Interviews with over 65s, who are the most at-risk group in society for CDI, were also used to discuss their safety concerns and provide them with information about genetic engineering and how we are using it. We talked through the risks and how we had dealt with them, you can read more about this on our public engagement page. 
                <br><br>
                 Within the technical aspects of the project, we have had an incredible amount of input from professors and experts who are all leaders in their field. We have also been very lucky to talk to lots of industry leaders about our project, including CEOs of microbiome start-ups: Zack Abbott from ZBiotics and Soren Thomensen from BioMe. Take a look at our timeline to see how each interaction influenced our design up to where we are today.

                                  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>We have to be careful drawing conclusions since our survey didn’t reach enough people and because it was distributed through social media it has reached a lot of our friends that are studying science at university and are more prone to being positive towards GMOs. However, from our survey, it can be concluded that people have a rather positive opinion towards GMO and are not against using GMO products.</p>

                                      <p>Some of the important results of our survey are highlighted here:

    <centre><div class="panel-body"><p>Our methods for conducting the survey were approved by our supervisors as well as the institution. We designed our survey in compliance with  the AAPOR  Task Force report “Evaluating Survey Quality in Today’s Complex Environment” and Best Practices for Survey Research guidelines: The survey was anonymised and our methods for conducting the survey were approved by our PIs and the institution, respectively. We pretested questionnaires and procedures and afterwards we tallied all of the surveys to get our final results. The survey itself contained a disclaimer paragraph informing the participants about the purpose of the survey, and contact information for any concerns. This was followed by two demographics questions, and then five questions designed to better understand public understanding, reaction and opinion of GMOs. Finally, two questions were designed to give us specific opinions about the drug designs of our individual projects. In the end participants could give us any further comments on our projects or survey, as well as any concerns. We purposefully decided against a fully multiple choice survey to give participants the chance to give their differentiated and unbiased opinion. Finally, we performed a detailed analysis of the survey to get the final results.       
        <br><br>      Overall, 221 people filled out our survey. Because it was an online survey, and we sent it out through social media amongst others we were aware that our polling population might have some bias. We saw this bias in our demographic results, where the average age was 29.3 years old and 24% were within typical university student age. However, we still think that our data can provide some useful insights into the general population’s opinions. 
        102 of the participants were from the UK, 54 from the Netherlands, 31 from Denmark, and 35 from other countries. As our survey was online and we used social media to publicise it, we were aware that our polling population might have some bias. As expected, we saw this bias in our demographic results, where the average age was 29.3 years old and 24% were within typical university student age. From graph 1 it can be seen that the majority of the people that answered our survey were under 25 years old: 64,5% were under 25 years old, 16,8% were between 25-40 years old, 12,1% were between 41-65 years old and 6,5% were over 65 years old. However, we still think that our data can provide some useful insights into the general public’s opinion.

      <p>The aim of the survey was to understand the general opinion about genetically modified organisms.  Our survey showed that most people are actually quite positive about genetic engineering. People over 65 years old are the most enthusiastic about genetic engineering. Amongst them over 60% answered that they are positive about genetic engineering, and 20 were positive to have GMOs with conditions. 20% were indecisive. The people under 25-year-old were the next most accepting of genetic engineering, then the people between 25-40 years old. The people between 41-65 were the least accepting of genetic engineering although only 12% were negative about it.
 
        <br><br> However, we need to be careful with the interpretation here since this could be also due to the sampling population since the survey was sent out by iGEM participants to their friends / family and the immediate surroundings of people working in iGEM might be positively biased since they are all in some way related to a person who has knowledge about this subject and also passionate about educating people on it.

      <p>We received an average rating of 3.2, which indicates a good mix of people from life science and other backgrounds. There is further a clear difference of knowledge about GMO across generation which could indicate gaps in education or outreach programmes.
        <br><br>Based on the previous question the following charts summarise the opinion of those who selected 1 and 5 previously. It is obvious that as knowledge increases so does positivity.

    <br>
    <p>Most of the people answering our survey have heard about genetic engineering in school (62%). A lot of the people answering our survey have also heard about genetic engineering in scientific publications and popular science media, suggesting that a lot of the people answering our survey are scientists. A lot of the people answering our survey have also heard about genetic engineering through general media showing that genetic engineering is a subject getting a lot of attention in the media currently.  As one participant mentioned: 
<br><br>
<i>“A lot of people (including myself) do not know that much about it [genetic engineering]. They have probably heard the word in school and some examples, but not really know the consequences or if it is really good or bad.”</i> Therefore, we should be careful in interpreting these results, in combination with our data on the opinions.</p>

    <br>
    <p>We asked all participants to name an example of genetic engineering, so we could estimate where their knowledge came from. We categorised their answers into: ‘agriculture/food’, ‘medicine’, ‘science’ and ‘no/wrong example’. It is interesting to note that each age group has a major area of knowledge: medicine (47.4%) for participants from 25-40; agriculture (65.4%) for participants from 41-65; science (60.0%) for participants of 65+. The group of participants under 25 years old had the most divided answers, but still ‘agriculture’ had a majority with 43.8%.</p>

    <br>
    <p>90% of participants said that they would take a GMO therapeutic, compared to 88% who would consider taking a diagnostic and 78% a preventative GMO. Based on this insight we will market our product as therapeutic in combination with a preventative (not solemnly preventative). 
      75% stated that they would be comfortable with an internal targeted pill, more than any other delivery method. Only an external gel was more accepted with 77%. Therefore, we decided to have our product delivered via a targeted pill capsule.</p>
      <img src="https://2019.igem.org/wiki/images/a/a8/T--Oxford--Graph7LCsurvey.png" style="width:100%" class="center"/><figcaption><i>Graph 7: Examples of when people would choose a product containing GMO</i></figcaption>
      <br>
      <p>We further tried to find out what a GMO drug would need to fulfill to replace a traditional treatment. From graph 7 we can conclude that people find effectiveness more important than price when judging whether to use a product containing a GMO. Of all participants, 89% indicated that they could be convinced by a GMO treatment with increased effect at a comparable or lower price, whereas 60% would consider a GMO drug with a lower price, but similar effectiveness. 72% would try a GMO treatment if there is no corresponding traditional treatment for that condition yet. This would be important to implement into the development of our products. It is also interesting to mention that 43% said they would still consider a GMO medicine even without an obvious advantage in effectiveness or price. This, in combination with the overall high response, provides further indication to the positive attitude towards GMO treatment. This might be due to the education people have received on genetic engineering, as one participant highlighted that 
<br><br>
<i>“people can be very fearful about new technology and myths are spread. Educating people will benefit society by reducing people’s reservations about GMOs so they can get the most effective treatment possible”.</i></p>
