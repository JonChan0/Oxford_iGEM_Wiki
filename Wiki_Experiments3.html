                  <h3>Choice of Strain</h3>

                  <h4><i>Escherichia coli</i> strains are commonly used host organisms in labs because they possess  several advantages. For example, they are cheap, replicate rapidly, and have well a characterised and optimised cloning and expression systems, and produce good yield of plasmid and many recombinant proteins. 
                  </h4>
                  <h4>In our project, we opted for using <i>E. coli</i> we had to amplify plasmid DNA, express proteins for purification or test constructs before they were transformed into <i>L. reuteri</i>. 
                  </h4>
                  <h4>We mainly used two strains for our <i>E. coli</i> work: NEBTurbo competent cells for cloning and BL21(DE3)-RIPL competent cells for protein expression.</h4>
               
                  <h3>Choice of Expression Vector</h3>
                  
                  <h4>Initially, we opted to use the pBAD33 vector with its arabinose-inducible promoter. This promoter can be tightly regulated by arabinose and can induce very strong expression<sup>10</sup>. However, for our constructs, induction with pBAD did not occur efficiently, hence our use of the IPTG-inducible T7 expression system in the pET28a vector.</h4>

                            <h4>For our project, we designed several constructs which were used for various experiments. To assemble these constructs, we used Gibson assembly.<sup>1</sup></h4>

                            <h4>The Gibson assembly offers a quick and easy method to construct DNA fragments and recombinant plasmids. DNA with overlapping ends are added Gibson assembly master mixes, which contain T5 exonuclease, <i>Taq</i>ligase, and Phusion DNA polymerase<sup>1</sup>.

                            <h4>Despite the Biobrick standard being based around restriction enzymes, we used Gibson Assembly to construct all of our recombinant plasmids. Having our main inserts synthesized by IDT, we only needed to clone the fragment into the corresponding vector. This was achieved by creating overhangs using appropriate primers in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the inserts and the vector backbones. The resulting fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis to purify only the bands corresponding to our fragment of interest. The purified DNA was then used for Gibson Assembly, which linked the fragments together, creating the final recombinant plasmid constructs.</h4>
          
                            <h4>Moreover, this method enabled us to easily troubleshoot our assemblies simply by ordering new primers. We encountered such issues, notably when we needed a construct with only a promoter and a reporter gene (e.g. erm-mClover3, ldh-mClover3) or when terminators made large IDT gBlocks difficult to synthesise. In both cases, we were able to attach parts together easily using PCR and Gibson assembly.
                              </h4>
          
                            <h4>The products of Gibson Assembly reactions were then transformed into <i>E. coli</i> (NEBTurbo) competent cells (made in-house). These colonies were selected on antibiotic-containing LB agar plates before colony PCR and validation by Sanger sequencing (Source Bioscience).</h4>

                      <h4>One of the main components of our experimental work was focused around CD27L, an endolysin from É¸CD27 bacteriophage that targeted <i>C. difficile</i>. CD27L is a protein with two domains: an N-terminal N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase homologue and a C-terminal domain. It has been argued that the N-terminal domain has the same specificity as the full length CD27L and improved catalytic activity.<sup>2</sup></h4>

                      <h4>We were interested in testing different versions of the endolysin (one from <a href="https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K895005">Team Dundee 2012</a> as well as a <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3183012">truncated</a> and <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3183009">full-length</a> endolysin) in different conditions, to see how it behaves in different environments. Thus, to carry out those experiments, we expressed both the CD27L and CD27L<sub>1-179</sub> endolysins, allowing us to compare them and test how they behave.

                      <h4>For our purification strategy, we expressed the endolysins in <i>E. coli</i> and purified it via  immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) to obtain a partially purified protein solution. Then, after confirming by SDS-PAGE that we had the correct product, we dialysed our protein into phosphate buffered saline (PBS). With such a purification strategy, we aimed to obtain a pure enough sample of active endolysin for killing  assays.</h4>
    
                      <h4>To express our endolysin, we fused our endolysin with a N-terminal 6x-His tag and a SpyTag<sup>3</sup>, which enables the utilisation of two different affinity chromatography (AC) methods, as well as tandem affinity purification (TAP). </h4>
    
                      <h4>The constructed part was cloned into an IPTG-inducible, T7 expression system-based pET28a vector. For our host organism, we used the BL21(DE3)-RIPL expression strain, which is optimized for the T7 expression system and rare codons. We grew our cells in LB at 37&deg;C and then induced the cultures in mid-log phase with IPTG at 180RPM 21&deg;C;. Following induction overnight, the cells were harvested using centrifugation and lysed by sonication. Purification was then carried out as mentioned above.</h4>
    
                      <h4>Our choice of buffer was based on previous kill assays in literature, which used PBS as the main buffer for the reaction<sup>2</sup>. Specifically, in cases where our yield was low (i.e. CD27L<sub>1-179</sub> construct), we used spin concentration to achieve total protein concentration suitable for killing assays.  </h4>
    
                      <h4>During purification, we encountered several issues with both the CD27L and CD27L<sub>1-179</sub> proteins. The latter was expressed at insufficiently high concentrations for assaying, so spin concentration was used to achieve high enough concentrations.</h4>
    
                      <h4>Additionally, our progress with CD27L was also hindered by the precipitation of our samples during dialysis. Specifically, our CD27L endolysin precipitated in substantial quantities (protein concentration decreasing from 5mg/ml to 0.3mg/ml) in three batches of our five.</h4>
    
                      <h4>Our initial hypothesis was that this occurred due to the lack of reducing conditions. This hypothesis was based on the structural model of CD27L, where it is shown there are several surface cysteine residues. However, adding beta-mercaptoethanol to all steps of purification, including dialysis, did not resolve this issue. Thus, to fully address this question, further investigation is required.</h4>
    
                      <h4>Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) was also planned to obtain higher purity samples. However, we decided that our one step affinity chromatography yielded sufficient purity for our particular CD27L applications.</h4>

                <h4>To test the CD27L endolysin, we had to create an assay demonstrating whether it is able to function as it was shown in the literature<sup>2,4</sup>. From such preliminary research, we discovered that CD27L, besides being active against <i>Clostiridoides difficile</i>, is also able to cleave amide bonds in the cell wall of other bacteria with the same peptidoglycan type, A1Î³. Thus, we used <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, a Category 1 Gram-positive bacterium<sup>2</sup> as our surrogate target due to safety concerns with the Category 2 <i>C. difficile</i>.</h4>
                <h4>In order to assay whether <i>B. subtilis</i> is lysed by our endolysin, we measured absorbance at 600nm (OD600) throughout an 8 hour time period at every 15 minutes. This way, we were able to monitor how the <i>B. subtilis</i> culture is affected by CD27L. </h4>
                <h4>Notably, our kill assay differs from the one described by Mayer et al. (2008)<sup>4</sup>. Their protocol involved washing and concentrating the cells to OD600 = 2.0 in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), followed by mixing with CD27L and measuring the rate of decrease in OD600. </h4>
                <h4>However, our protocol involved growing up a <i>B. subtilis</i> culture until they reached mid-log phase (OD600 â 0.6), then diluting them in Lysogenic Broth (LB), adding our solution (CD27L or Lysozyme or PBS) and then measuring the growth over time by monitoring the change in OD600. The measurements were made automatically by a plate reader, BMG FLUOstar Omega and the cells were grown in a 96 well plate from Greiner (CellStarÂ® 96 well plate F-type). </h4>

                

                <br>

                <h4>To explore the capabilities of the endolysin, we carried out killing assays under different conditions. First, we tested the concentration dependence of our endolysin activity. Second, we tested the specificity of our endolysin by assaying CD27L against both <i>E. coli</i> and <i>L. reuteri</i>. </h4>
                <h4>Given that our CD27L construct has a SpyTag, we were also able to attempt protein oligomerisation to see greater activity from the oligomer. The SpyTag/SpyCatcher system allows for irreversible protein conjugation through the formation of an isopeptide bond. Oligomerisation can be achieved using previously characterised SpyCatcher-o-Hept. This contains SpyCatcher/Coiled-Coil monomers that forms heptamers in solution<sup>5</sup>. Although we attempted oligomerisation, our data were ultimately inconclusive.</h4>
                <h4>Additionally, we performed scanning electron microscopy on our <i>B. subtilis</i> samples. Such a technique allowed us to visually confirm changes in <i>B. subtilis</i> cell wall morphology upon application of endolysin. This supports the hypothesis that the endolysin acts to degrade the peptidoglycan cell wall, ultimately causing lysis.<sup>2</sup></h4>

                <li>the potential for efficient endolysin production and secretion</li>

              </ol>

              <h4>Regarding the first criterion, many of the <i>Lactobacillus</i> species have been shown to successfully colonise the gut and even promote its normal physiology, while also inhibiting the proliferation of specific pathogenic species<sup>10</sup>. </h4>

              <h4>Regarding the second criterion, the genus has the added advantage of belonging to the group of Gram-positive bacteria, which we thought to be relevant for the secretion of the CD27L endolysin. This is given the lack of the potential barrier of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. At the same time, the lack of an outer membrane would facilitate the diffusion of the autoinducer peptide (AIP) of <i>C. difficile</i> (indeed, itself a Gram positive species) to the AgrC receptor. </h4>

              <h4>Regarding the third criterion, <i>L. reuteri</i> has previously been shown to express the AgrAC system from <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and have protein expression induced by its corresponding AIP<sup>11</sup>. As part of our project, we aimed to show that the CD27L endolysin can be expressed and released into the extracellular milieu by <i>L. reuteri</i> and that AgrAC can be expressed and carry out its normal function.</h4>
<h4>Our work ultimately sought to exploit these potential benefits within the context of Synthetic Biology. We hope that some of the information we have gathered on this chassis sets a foundation for future teams to build upon.</h4>

This was due to the particular methylation patterns on our <i>E. coli</i>-derived DNA. In our endeavour to resolve this issue, we turned to the Quadram Institute in Norwich, who have kindly helped us by providing a <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> 100-23c strain, for which transformation worked seamlessly.  </h4>

                <h4>While we did not have enough time to express the protein successfully in our chassis, we have shown that constitutive protein expression brings about significant cellular stress; this has been determined by a combination of growth assays, fluorometry and fluorescence microscopy. Though such results have not been desirable, they open new avenues for approaching for expression strategies to limit cellular stress and strongly support the use of an AIP-inducible system.</h4>
